# A python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time
P = 1000 # (P) is the principal amount (initial investment)
R = 0.05 # (R) is the annual interest rate
T = 3 #(T) is the time the money is invested in years
I = float(P * R * T)
print("The simple interest is", I)
